Hashtable
=========

a hashtable implementation in C.

The hash function was borrowed from [a very nice article on hashtables](http://powerfield-software.com/?p=615.).

Most of the code is similar to the implementation in the article.

**Update:** Because of the license notice in the addendum of the above article, the hash function changed to
the one in [this later article by the same author](http://powerfield-software.com/?p=1240).
